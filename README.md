# Machine-Learning-Based-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction-Using-Synthetic-Minority-Oversampling-Technique

This project aims to assess the efficiency, adaptiveness, 
and feasibility of various Machine Learning Algorithms for 
predicting mortality rates inside the hospital. The predictors 
and factors associated with in-hospital mortality rates in 
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and other emergency sections have 
been poorly organized and categorized. Various Data Mining 
Techniques, and Machine Learning algorithms like Random 
Forest, XG-Boost, and Decision Tree, have been employed over 
a legitimate public dataset of various patients and their 
performance is measured and compared within and with 
existing works.
